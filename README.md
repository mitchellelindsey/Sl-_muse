Hi, my name is Ohuabunwa Chinenye.  
I’m the creator of Slō muse, a loungewear brand that celebrates slowing down, embracing comfort, and living beautifully.

# Project Overview
This project is the landing page for Slō muse, designed to reflect the brand’s aesthetic: minimal, elegant, and timeless.  

The site takes and uses a soft color palette of white, brown, and dusty pink, along with carefully selected fonts (The Seasons, Dream Avenue, Resolve, and Gill Sans) to embody the brand’s identity.
